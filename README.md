### Getting Started

This document is set up a **Gitbook** and hosted on **Github**. When you read this, you were already granted access to the repository so the first step is done.

The easist way to start contributing is to download **Gitbook Editor **\(available for Mac, Linux, Windows\) from [here.](https://www.gitbook.com/editor)

**Before you add / change anything, please read through the Contribution Guide.**

### Contribution Guide

> Tell others what you work on \| Write meaningful commit messages \| Push often \| Use American English

**Why is there a contribution guide?** I think it is in everyone's best interest to keep this summary as easy to understand as possible for everyone. This guideline should help to maintain consistency across the entire document.

Each section may contain a short additional information on how to format things specific to that section. Please have a look there as well.

#### 1. Adding new content

##### 1.1 Adding minor updates

If you add minor updates, like the answer to a single question, you can do this on the `develop` branch directly. Make sure your commit has a meaningful message.

##### 1.2 Adding major updates

If you add major updates, like several related changes \(e.g. an entire lecture summary\), go along as follows:

1. Add a new **issue** on Github, describing what you are working on
2. Create a `feature/<issue-name>`branch and add your changes
3. Open a pull-request to merge back into `develop`and add the other contributers as reviewers
4. Once the pull request is merged, delete your feature branch and close the issue by referencing the merge commit

**Why so complicated? **This way the issues reflect new changes and are transparent for all contributors.

#### 2. Challenging existing content

If you find obvious mistakes \(typos, clearly wrong statements\) just change them directly.

If you are challenging statements, answers to questions etc. which might not be trivial to understand go along as follows:

1. Open a new **issue** on github.
2. Reference the the statement in question you consider to be wrong
3. Provide an explanation why you think it is wrong
4. Provide your correct solution.

#### 3. Adding new contributors

The purpose of this document is to foster collaborative learning - hence to make this as inclusive as possible. This being said, too many collaborators would probably lead to chaos ðŸ’¥. If you know other students personally, you want to add to the project shoot me a message and we will figure it out.
