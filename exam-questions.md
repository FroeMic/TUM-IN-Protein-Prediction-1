### Contribution Guide: Exam Questions

Since all questions here are answered by students, there might be some mistakes in them. Hence a few more words on how to best handle this section.

#### 1. Adding a new question

Just add the question in the respective file. Optimally, you can already provide an answer.

#### 2. Answering a question

To clearly distinguish questions from answers, please put answers in **blockquotes **right under the respective question.

##### Example: 

* How can 1D secondary structure information be used to derive a 3D model?
* > It is not possible to derive a 3D model from 1D information. \(Trick Question\)

#### 3. Updating an answer

If you think an answer does not properly answer a question \(e.g. it is wrong or the answer is not sufficient\), mark the answer and open a new **issue **on Github to discuss the question and share your improved answer. 

\(Use the ❓emoji to mark the possibly wrong answer inline\)
