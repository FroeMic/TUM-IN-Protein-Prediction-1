## 3.1 Lecture Questions

> This section contains possible exam questions asked Professor Rost in the lectures he dedicated to answering student questions. They are **highly relevant, **because he will sample exam questions from this pool.



**Question: **When I build a profile of a famliy: Do they share the same structure? Should I verify that they do? How do i do that?

> The very assumption is that the proteins of one family share the same structure and function. When iteratively refining the profile with proteins retrieved by _profile-sequence_ of \_profile-profile \_comparison \(from the twilight- / midnight-zone\), it can make sense to double check the new proteins with secondary structure prediction to avoid adding false-positives.
