## 3.1 Lecture Questions

> This section contains possible exam questions asked Professor Rost in the lectures he dedicated to answering student questions. They are **highly relevant, **because he will sample exam questions from this pool.

### Questions

**1\) Question: **When I build a profile of a famliy: Do they share the same structure? Should I verify that they do? How do i do that?

> The very assumption is that the proteins of one family share the same structure and function. When iteratively refining the profile with proteins retrieved by _profile-sequence_ of \_profile-profile \_comparison \(from the twilight- / midnight-zone\), it can make sense to double check the new proteins with secondary structure prediction to avoid adding false-positives.

**2\) Question: **Cross-Validation: What is it? How does it work? Why do we need it?

**3\) Question: **What is the difference between a BLOSUM matrix and a PSSM \(Position Specific Substitution Matrix\)?

**4\) Question: **What is the most successful method to predict 3D structure?

**5\) Question: **How can you predict structure in the \[a\] daylight- \[b\] twilight- \[c\] midnight-zone?
