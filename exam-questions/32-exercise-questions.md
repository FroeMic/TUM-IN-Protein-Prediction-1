## 3.2 Exercise Questions

> This section contains possible exam questions asked and answered as part of the exercises.

#### Exercise 2: Protein Structure

**Question:** What are the building blocks of proteins?

> * Proteins are polypeptides, which consist of amino acids as building blocks

**Question:** Define protein backbone and amino acid side chain in 1 or 2 sentences for each term.

> * **Backbone:** All amino acids have the same with an N-Terminus on one and a C-Terminus on the other side by which they are chained up into a protein. \(Always read / write from N- to C-Terminus\) 
> * **Side Chain:** Each Amino Acid has a different side chain, which equips it with unique features \(length, polar, non-polar, electrically charged\)

**Question:** How many amino acids appear in proteins? How can they be classified?

> All proteins are built from **20 different amino acids**. The can be classified into the following 5 groups /categories
>
> * positively electrically charged side chain 
> * negatively electrically charged side chain
> * polar uncharged side chains
> * hydrophobic side chains
> * special cases

**Question:** Name atom types involved in a hydrogen bond. Do S-H groups form hydrogen bonds? Why \(not\)?

> Hydrogen bonds normally involve
>
> * an **H **atom \(obviously\) as donor
> * either an **O** or **N** atom as acceptor
>
> Due to its lower electronegativity Sulfur does not engage in classical Hydrogen-Bonds. \(However nonclassical hydrogen bonds with Sulfur seem to exist, according to literature\)

**Question:** How are alpha helices held together?

> Alpha-Helices are stabilized by **hydrogen bonds** along the backbone. Every turn takes about **3,6 **residues.

**Question: **What is similar and what is different in the hydrogen bonding of the alpha helix and the beta sheet?

> * Hydrogen bonds in **Alpha Helices** are 'ultra-local' and occur along the backbone of the helix \(each 3.6 residues\)
> * Hydrogen bonds between **Beta Sheets** happen between the beta-strands \(running parallel or antiparallel\) which can be rather far apart in sequence.

**Question: **Why do we find "forbidden" areas in a Ramachandran plot?

> The Ramachandran plot shows the angles $$(\phi,\ \psi)$$ of amino acids in which alpha-helices and beta sheet are typically observed. Forbidden areas are those that are not possible due to physical constraints due to e.g. the side chain of the amino acid.

**Question:** What is a protein domain?

> ?

**Question:** How many amino acids are typically found a in a domain? Why is there a minimum/maximum size?

> ?

##### 2.2 PDB

**Question:** How many structures are stored in the PDB? How many of those are protein structures?

> ?

**Question:** Which experimental methods are \(mainly\) used to determine the structures? How long does it on average take to find the 3D structure for one protein for each method?

> ?

**Question:** How many human \("Homo sapiens"\) protein structures are in the PDB?

> ?

**Question:** Why does the number of protein structures already decreases when reducing at 100% sequence identity? Why does it decrease when reducing at even lower sequence identity further?

> * The PDB has redundant 3D structures for certain proteins from different experiments. This has different reasons such as competing groups, different research goals, better resolution.
> * Since most proteins developed under evolutionary pressure, large parts of proteins of the same family share a high sequence overlap.
