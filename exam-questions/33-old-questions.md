### 3.3.1 Exam Structure: 2016ST

> We where able to obtain last years exam structure. Let's try to answer all of the concrete questions :-\)

_Part 1 is mandatory, for the rest choose 3 out of 4._

##### **1. Multiple Choice \(5 questions, 10 points\)**

* Secondary Structure

* 100% sequence identity =&gt; same structure? \(PIDE\)
* Can modern prediction methods correctly predict structure in the midnight zone?
* About "Cryo-Microscope" ❓
* About "X-Rays" ❓

##### 2**. Sequence Alignment \(10 points\)**

* Explain each of the following alignment techniques and provide one method for each

  * Sequence - Sequence
  * Sequence - Profile
  * Profile - Profile

* General scoring BLOSUM62 matrix vs. PSSM
* Why is the sequence information valuable?
* How BLAST speed up pairwise alignments?
* Global vs Local alignment

##### 3**. Sequence Structure \(10 points\)**

* What data is needed to predict the structure with ML?
* Which tools and db you will use?
* How to prepare data for ML
* Which 2-3 features will help to predict?
* Would you apply method to all protein \(query\)?
* Which measure would you use to evaluate your method?

##### 4**. Protein Structure \(10 points\)**

* Why it is important to know 3d structure?
* Why is it so hard to compare 3D structure?
* Most successful ML algorithm for predicting structure, steps
