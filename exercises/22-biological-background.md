#### 1. Keywords

##### 1.1 Unit and Dimension

**Molecular Mass**

* **Unit:** 1 **u** or **Da** is defined as$$\frac{1}{12}$$ of the mass of $${}^{12}C$$ isotope

* **Mole:** Amount of Substance, which contains as many elementary entites as atoms in $$0,012 kg\ of\ {}^{12}C$$ isotope

* **Avogadro Constant:** $$N_A$$ or $$L$$, entities per mole and is defined as $$6,022 * 10^{23}\     mol^{−1}$$

**Spatial dimensions:**

* **Ångström:** 1 Å is equivalent to $$0,1\ nm$$ or $$100\ pm$$
* Radius of atoms: $$0,3 - 3$$ Å
* Distance of different chemical bonds:
  * **C-C:** $$154\ pm$$
  * **C=C:** $$134\ pm$$
  * **C-H:** $$109\ pm$$
  * **C-O:** $$143\ pm$$
  * **C=O:** $$120\ pm$$
  * **C-N:** $$147\ pm$$
  * **N-H:** $$101\ pm$$
* Average weight of amino acid: $$100 - 110\ Da$$
* Typical length for soluble proteins: $$3 - 6\ nm$$
  * ~ 300 amino acids for prokaryotic proteins
  * ~ 400 amino acids for eukaryotic proteins

##### 1.2 Morphology - Cellular Structure

**Terms:**

1. Cell **Membrane**: A selective barrier separating the inside of a cell / organelle from the outside, consisting of a **phospholipid bilayer**.
2. **Cytoplasm:** semi-liquid medium inside the cytoplasm membrane
3. **Cytoplasmatic Membrane:** the membrane around the cell
4. **Cell Compartment:** a region within the cell mostly enclosed by a membrane
5. **Cell Organelle:** a special type of compartment that has a certain function within the cell
6. **Nucleus:** a membrane enclosed volume of the cell, which contains most of the genomic material
7. **Cell Wall:** Some cells have an extra cellular rigid layer

**Cell Organelles:** Ribosome, Mitochondrium, Chloroplasts

**Prokaryotic vs Eukaryotic Cells:**

| Eukaryotic Cell | Prokaryotic Cell |
| :--- | :--- |
| membrane enclosed compartments | No membrane enclosed compartments |
| genomic material in nucleus | Genomic Material located in nucleoid region |
| organelles: mitochondria, chloroplasts | No organelles |
| compartments:  endoplasmatic reticulum, Golgi-apparatus |  |

##### 1.3 Biomolecule classes, building blocks and physiological function

**Hydrophilic**: likes to interact with water because of partial electrical charges \(mostly polar\)  
**Hydrophobic:** avoids interaction with water, because of distinct charging points \(mostly non-polar\)

**Lipophilic:** likes to interact with fatty / unpolar molecules \(-&gt; hydrophobic\)  
**Lipophobic:** avoids interaction with fatty / unpolar molecules \(-&gt; hydrophilic\)

**Biomolecules**

* typically polymers \(= constructed from many identical or similar residues\)
* can form complexes
* can contain both hydrophilic and lipophilic parts

**Carbohydrates:** \(sugars\)

* molecule consisting of **C, H, O **atom
* $$C_m(H_2O)_n$$ - usually hydrogen-oxygen ratio of 2:1 
* hydrophilic
* purpose: fuel, energy storage, structural components, ... 

**Lipids:**

* loosely defined as **being soluble in non-polar solvents**
* fats, waxes, vitamins, ...
* purpose: energy storage, signaling, structural components

**Glycerolipids: ** \(Phospholipids\)

* Glycerol with 3 docking slots \(hydrophobic\)
* 3 fatty acids: triglycerids \(energy storage\)
* 2 fatty acids + 1 phosphate group: **Phospholipid**, major building block of membranes

**Nucleic Acids:**

* Store and transmit genetic information
* A polymer built out of **Nucelotides** \(base+sugar+phosphate\)
  * hydrophobic nucleobases on the inside
  * hydrophilic backbone \(phosphate + sugar\)
* **RNA:** single stranded, but can adopt complex secondary structure with itself or other RNA
* **DNA:** typically double stranded \(**double helix**\) formed by a reverse-compliment strand
  * Has a **5' end** and a **3' end**.
  * always annotated from **5' to 3'**
* Bonds: non-covalent **hydrogen bonds** \(rather weak\)

**Proteins:**

* polymerized amino acids
* _work horse_ or _machinery of life_
* functions
  * catalysis of chemical reactions \(enzymes\)
  * structural elements \(collagen fibers\)
  * sensing
  * immune system
  * etc ...
