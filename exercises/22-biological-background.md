##### 1.2 Morphology - Cellular Structure

**Terms:**

1. Cell **Membrane**: A selective barrier separating the inside of a cell / organelle from the outside, consisting of a **phospholipid bilayer**.
2. **Cytoplasm:** semi-liquid medium inside the cytoplasm membrane
3. **Cytoplasmatic Membrane:** the membrane around the cell
4. **Cell Compartment:** a region within the cell mostly enclosed by a membrane
5. **Cell Organelle:** a special type of compartment that has a certain function within the cell
6. **Nucleus:** a membrane enclosed volume of the cell, which contains most of the genomic material
7. **Cell Wall:** Some cells have an extra cellular rigid layer

**Cell Organelles:** Ribosome, Mitochondrium, Chloroplasts

**Prokaryotic vs Eukaryotic Cells:**

| Eukaryotic Cell | Prokaryotic Cell |
| :--- | :--- |
| membrane enclosed compartments | No membrane enclosed compartments |
| genomic material in nucleus | Genomic Material located in nucleoid region |
| organelles: mitochondria, chloroplasts | No organelles |
| compartments:  endoplasmatic reticulum, Golgi-apparatus |  |

##### 1.3 Biomolecule classes, building blocks and physiological function

**Hydrophilic**: likes to interact with water because of partial electrical charges \(mostly polar\)  
**Hydrophobic:** avoids interaction with water, because of distinct charging points \(mostly non-polar\)

**Lipophilic:** likes to interact with fatty / unpolar molecules \(-&gt; hydrophobic\)  
**Lipophobic:** avoids interaction with fatty / unpolar molecules \(-&gt; hydrophilic\)

**Biomolecules**

* typically polymers \(= constructed from many identical or similar residues\)
* can form complexes
* can contain both hydrophilic and lipophilic parts

**Carbohydrates:** \(sugars\)

* molecule consisting of **C, H, O **atom
* $$C_m(H_2O)_n$$ - usually hydrogen-oxygen ratio of 2:1 
* hydrophilic
* purpose: fuel, energy storage, structural components, ... 

**Lipids:**

* loosely defined as **being soluble in non-polar solvents**
* fats, waxes, vitamins, ...
* purpose: energy storage, signaling, structural components

**Glycerolipids: ** \(Phospholipids\)

* Glycerol with 3 docking slots \(hydrophobic\)
* 3 fatty acids: triglycerids \(energy storage\)
* 2 fatty acids + 1 phosphate group: **Phospholipid**, major building block of membranes

**Nucleic Acids:**

* Store and transmit genetic information
* A polymer built out of **Nucelotides** \(base+sugar+phosphate\)
  * hydrophobic nucleobases on the inside
  * hydrophilic backbone \(phosphate + sugar\)
* **RNA:** single stranded, but can adopt complex secondary structure with itself or other RNA
* **DNA:** typically double stranded \(**double helix**\) formed by a reverse-compliment strand
  * Has a **5' end** and a **3' end**.
  * always annotated from **5' to 3'**
* Bonds: non-covalent **hydrogen bonds** \(rather weak\)

**Proteins:**

* polymerized amino acids
* _work horse_ or _machinery of life_
* functions
  * catalysis of chemical reactions \(enzymes\)
  * structural elements \(collagen fibers\)
  * sensing
  * immune system
  * etc ... 

##### 1.4 Genetics

**Gene:** Any discrete locus of heritable, genomic sequence which affect an organism's traits by being expressed as a functional product or by regulation of gene expression  
= every subsequence of DNA that encodes a functional protein

**Central Dogma of Molecular Biology: \(!!!\)** Describes the flow of information from **DNA** to **RNA** to **Protein**![](/assets/Screen Shot 2017-07-04 at 14.35.46.png)

**1\) Replication:** Duplication of DNA

* highly controlled, carried out by multi-protein complex
* for each strand in the double helix, a complementary strand is synthesized
* in **5' -&gt; 3'** direction

**2\) Transcription:** Creation of working copy of genes

* synthesis of a single stranded RNA from a template sequence in the DNA \(after a promoter region\)
* carried out by a multi protein complex
* the resulting **mRNA** undergoes several maturing steps before Translation
  * mRNA: translated into protein
  * xRNA: function
  * rRNA: component of the Ribosome
  * tRNA: amino acid carrier for translation

**3\) Translation:** Conversion of **mRNA** into protein

* carried out by **ribosomen**
* starts with **AUG** codon
* by default: Sequence of RNA and Protein are noted in the same direction

**Inheritance / Mutation:** Copy errors lead to rise of evolution

* Mutation Types
  * \(longe range\) rearrangements
  * point mutations
* **Rearrangements**
  * rearrangements of DNA segments due to error in recombination process
  * induced by
    * DNA damage \(chemical, radiation\)
    * virus infections
  * consequences: loss of gene functions or loss of controls
* **Point Mutations**
  * change of a single DNA residue
  * **Frame-Shift** \(loss / gain of a single residue\), effect rather unpredictable
  * **Substitution **
    * Transition: A &lt;--&gt; G or C &lt;--&gt; T
    * Transversion: A,G &lt;--&gt; C, T
    * Consequences: 
      * silent
      * missense \(= amino acid change\)
      * nonsense \(= stop codon introduced\)
      * affects splicing site
  * Induced by: replication errors

**Gene Regulation:** Takes place on several layers

* transcription rate
* stability of mRNA
* translation

##### 1.5 Metabolism / Physiology

**Anabolism:** Reactions that aim to the synthesis of a new substance  
**Catabolism:** Reactions that aim to the degradation of a substance \(energy generation, removal of damaged structures\)

**steady state / equilibrium:** degradation and synthesis rate are balance \(System is dynamically stable\)
