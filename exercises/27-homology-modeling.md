#### 1. Ideas and Keywords

##### Ideas

* Sequence Determination \(short: sequencing\) of DNA is highly automated today and very cheap
* Computer programs can help identify genes and coding regions
* From coding regions you can infer the protein sequence \(1D information\)
* **The entire sequencing process is cheap and quick, everything after that isn't.**

##### Available types of Data

* sequences \(1D information\)
* Annotations of already investigated proteins
* \(few\) protein structures \(3D information\)
* **Goal:** clever combination to infer more knowledge about yet unknown protein

##### Additional Tools / Databases

* UniProtKB, PDB
* Blast, Smith-Waterman
* PSI-Blast, ClustalW/CluastlX, MaxHom, SAM / HMMer, T-Coffee 
* HHblits: SSearch, PSI-Search

#### 2. Exercises

##### Questions

**Question:** How does ClustalW work? How does it differ from BLAST?

**Question:** What s HHblits?
