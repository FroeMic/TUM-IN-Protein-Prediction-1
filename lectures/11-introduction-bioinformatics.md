#### 1. Defintions

**Computational Biology:** Biology Replacing experiments by computers \(including neurobiology, image processing\)

**Bioinformatics: **anything that has to do with storing and using the information about bio-sequences

#### 2. **Biology Introduction**

Central to biology is the question: _How does life work?_

**Question: **What is common to life?

> DNA, Protein, RNA

**Question: **How many bacteria do we care around?

> About 2 kilos. Humans carry around more bacterial DNA than human DNA.

**Question: **Which elements make up life?

* 65.0 %    - O, Oxygen
* 18.6 %    - C, Carbon
* 9.7 %     - H, Hydrogen
* 3.2 %     - N, Nitrogen
* 1.8 %     - Ca, Calcium
* 1.0  %    - P, Phosphorus

**Question: **What is life? Can you define it?

> Descriptive definitions of life:
>
> * Homeostatis \(regulation of internal environment to maintain constant state\)  
> * Organization \(Unit: Cells\)  
> * Metabolism  
> * Growth  
> * Adaptation  
> * Response to stimuli  
> * Reproduction

**Question: **Are viruses life?

> Strictly speaking NO. Viruses on their own cannot replicate and thus are not alive. However, one could say that viruses are alive / represent life once they infected a cell and replicate.

##### 2.1 Organisms

###### Different Type of Cells:

###### **Prokaryotic Cells: **Mainly found in bacteria and archaea.

* no nucleus
* usually unicellular
* no cell organells

**Eukaryotic Cells:** Found in animals and plants

* nucleus
* usually mulicellular
* cell organelles

Note: _The density within cells can be described as almost solid._

###### Questions

**Question:**What is the smallest building block of life that can replicate?

> cells

**Question:**How many different cells are in a typical human?

> 200

**Question:**What are the parts of the cell called?

> organelles

**Question:**Which part of the cell is called the "powerhouse"?

> mitochondria

**Question:**What part of a plant is involved with photosynthesis?

> chloroplast

**Question:**What is mitosis?

> cell division

**Question:**Who first used the term cell?

> Robert Hooke

**Question:**How many elements are found in amounts larger than trace amounts \(0.01%\) in our bodies?

> 11

**Question:**When communities of living things interact with non living things they are called ... ?

> ecosystem

**Question:**The most common molecule in the human body is ... ?

> Water: H\_2O

**Question:**What do bacteria have in common?

> Single Cells

##### 2.2 Genes

##### 2.4 Central Dogma

**DNA: **Stores genetical information in a 4 letter alphabet. Double stranded helix.

**RNA**: Working copy of DNA, needed to produce a protein. \(Oversimplification\). Single stranded. Different types of RNA.

**Protein: ** Composed of 20 letter alphabet \(amino acids\). Machinery of Life: Proteins do the work in our body.

**Transcription:** Process of turning a part of the DNA \(a gene\) into RNA.

**Translation:** Process of turning a RNA strand into a protein. One amino acid is encoded as a RNA nucleotides triplet.

_In rare cases it is also possible that RNA translate to either RNA or DNA_
