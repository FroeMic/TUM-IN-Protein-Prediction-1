#### 1. Defintions

**Computational Biology:** Biology Replacing experiments by computers \(including neurobiology, image processing\)

**Bioinformatics: **anything that has to do with storing and using the information about bio-sequences

#### 2. **Biology Introduction**

Central to biology is the question: _How does life work?_

**Question: **What is common to life?

> DNA, Protein, RNA

Which elements make up life?

* 65.0 %    - O, Oxygen
* 18.6 %    - C, Carbon
* 9.7 %     - H, Hydrogen
* 3.2 %     - N, Nitrogen
* 1.8 %     - Ca, Calcium
* 1.0  %    - P, Phosphorus

##### 2.1 Organisms

**Question: **What do bacteria have in common?

> Single Cells

###### Different Type of Cells:

**Prokaryote: **

**Eukaryote:**

##### 2.2 Genes

**DNA: **Stores genetical information in a 4 letter alphabet. Double stranded helix.

**RNA**: Working copy of DNA, needed to produce a protein. \(Oversimplification\). Single stranded. Different types of RNA.

**Protein: ** Composed of 20 letter alphabet \(amino acids\). Machinery of Life: Proteins do the work in our body.

**Transcription:** Process of turning a part of the DNA \(a gene\) into RNA.

**Translation:** Process of turning a RNA strand into a protein. One amino acid is encoded as a RNA nucleotides triplet.
