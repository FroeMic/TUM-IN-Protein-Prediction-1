#### 1. Recap

#### 2. Intro

**Proteins are dynamic structures and thus they move.**

* Ligand Binding
* Catalysis
* Folding
* Allosteric Regulation \(?\)
* Libration \(?\)
* Sidechain rotation
* Vibration

##### Features of Disorder

* Efficient binders \(larger interface / outreach\)
* Regulated through post-translation modifications
* Increasing complexity by structural plasticity
  * having a "key" for different locks \(bindings sites\) -&gt; bind to different subtrates
* Active only in **disordered version** \(large difference between on and off\)
* **Disorder is used for**
  * buffering
  * extending reach \(binding\)
  * extending reach \(signaling\)

##### Coupled binding an folding

* Fly casting: increase surface to 'reach out'
* Initial contacts weak and non-specific
* Folding upon approach of target

##### Types of natively unstructured regions

* unstructured 
* molten globule
* linked folded domains
* mostly folded local disorder

#### 3. Disordered Data

**Database:** DisProt - a database for disordered proteins  
**NORS:** no regulary structure  
**Loopy Disorder:** less than 5% helices / strand and more than 70 residues

* not found in PDB
* with a \(little\) relaxation long 'connecting' loops in protein were found
* about **10% of biomass** genome has such \(weird\) structures \(most of them in Eukaryotes\)
