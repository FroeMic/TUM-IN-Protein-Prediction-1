#### 1. Recap

#### 2. Structure Determines Function

Proteins are dynamic structures and thus they move.

* Ligand Binding
* Catalysis
* Folding
* Allosteric Regulation \(?\)
* Libration \(?\)
* Sidechain rotation
* Vibration

#### 3. Disordered Data

**Natively unstructured regions:** a protein sequence that in solvent is unstructured \(2 time points will give different images\), but upon binding adopts a secondary structure \(induced fit\)

##### Features of Disorder

* Efficient binders \(larger interface / outreach\)
* Regulated through post-translation modifications
* Increasing complexity by structural plasticity
  * having a "key" for different locks \(bindings sites\) -&gt; bind to different subtrates
* Active only in **disordered version** \(large difference between on and off\)

##### Coupled binding an folding

* Fly casting: increase surface to 'reach out'
* Initial contacts weak and non-specific
* Folding upon approach of target
