#### 1. Recap

**Common to Life:** DNA / Cells

**Proteins:** Machinery of Life - they do everything that needs to be done

* about **85 Million **known protein sequences
* about 120 000 known 3D structures of proteins in PDB
* between 20.000 and 25.000 proteins in a typical human
* protein length \(in amino acids\): 35 - 30.000, with a median around 400

**Central Dogma / Informationflow:** DNA -&gt; RNA -&gt; Proteins![](/assets/Screen Shot 2017-07-01 at 19.42.14.png)**Translation:** Proteins are made up of amino acids \(20 different kinds\). Each amino acids is encoded by a nucleotide triplet \(codon\) of DNA / RNA.

#### 2. Proteins and Domains

# It is important to realize that every representation of a protein (sequence, image, ...) is 
# only a representation of reality.
```

##### 2.1 Amino Acids

Proteins are built up out of a chain of amino acids. These amino acids are joined into a **linear polypeptide chain**, a protein.

* Each **residue** \(amino acid\) in this chain has a backbone and a side chain
* Different amino acids have **different side-chains**
* Each amino acids has **the same backbone**, along which they are chained
* Proteins are always chained up from the **N-Terminus **to the **C-Terminus** in a condensation reaction 
  \(a H20 molecule is released\)
