#### 1. Recap

**Common to Life:** DNA / Cells

**Proteins:** Machinery of Life - they do everything that needs to be done

* about **85 Million **known protein sequences
* about 120 000 known 3D structures of proteins in PDB
* between 20.000 and 25.000 proteins in a typical human
* protein length \(in amino acids\): 35 - 30.000, with a median around 400

**Central Dogma / Informationflow:** DNA -&gt; RNA -&gt; Proteins![](/assets/Screen Shot 2017-07-01 at 19.42.14.png)**Translation:** Proteins are made up of amino acids \(20 different kinds\). Each amino acids is encoded by a nucleotide triplet \(codon\) of DNA / RNA.

##### 2.1 Amino Acids

Proteins are built up out of a chain of amino acids. These amino acids are joined into a **linear polypeptide chain**, a protein. Each protein is therefore a combination of the **20 different types of amino acids.**

* Each **residue** \(amino acid\) in this chain has a backbone and a side chain
* Different amino acids have **different side-chains**
* Each amino acids has **the same backbone**, along which they are chained
* Proteins are always chained up from the **N-Terminus **to the **C-Terminus** in a condensation reaction 
  \(a H20 molecule is released\)

###### Side Chains

Amino acids only differ in their side chains. These side chains determine the chemical properties of the respective amino acid. There are the following _features_ an amino acid can have:

* polar \(hydrophilic, likes water\)
* non-polar \(hydrophobic, avoids water\)
* acidic \(negatively charged\)
* basic \(positively charged\)

**Question: **How many different amino acids are there?

> 20

**Question: **How do amino acids differ? What do they have in common?

> Different amino acids have different side-chains, which influence the chemical features of the respective amino acid. All of them share the same backbone.

**Question: **In which different feature groups can you categorize amino acids?

> polar, non-polar, acidic \(negatively charged\), basic \(positively charged\)

**Question:** Draw the basic chemical structure of an amino acid.

```
H   R   O
 \  |  /
  N-C-C
 /  |  \
H   H   O-H
```

**Question:** How are amino acids linked together to form a protein?

> In the translation process, a **Ribosome **translates a **mRNA** strand to a protein, by decoding the RNA triplets into amino acids and then linking the amino acids by peptide bonds. They chaining ALWAYS happens from the **N-Terminus **to the **C-Terminus  **releasing an H20 molecule as part of the reaction.

##### 2.2 Protein Structure

###### What is a gene?

A gene is a region of DNA, which contains all information for the creation of an entire RNA strand. \( = protein\)![](/assets/Screen Shot 2017-07-01 at 20.26.17.png)**UTR: **Untranslated region \(leader sequence, header sequence\)

**Exon:** Part of a gene that will encode a part of the final mature RNA

**Intron:** Part of a gene that will be removed by **RNA Splicing** before the protein is translated
