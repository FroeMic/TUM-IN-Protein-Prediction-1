#### 1. Recap

**Common to Life:** DNA / Cells

**Proteins:** Machinery of Life - they do everything that needs to be done

* about **85 Million **known protein sequences
* about 120 000 known 3D structures of proteins in PDB
* between 20.000 and 25.000 proteins in a typical human
* protein length \(in amino acids\): 35 - 30.000, with a median around 400

**Central Dogma / Informationflow:** DNA -&gt; RNA -&gt; Proteins![](/assets/Screen Shot 2017-07-01 at 19.42.14.png)**Translation:** Proteins are made up of amino acids \(20 different kinds\). Each amino acids is encoded by a nucleotide triplet \(codon\) of DNA / RNA.
