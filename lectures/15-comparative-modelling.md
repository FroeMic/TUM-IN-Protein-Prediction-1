#### 1. Recap

* Profile-Sequence comparisons are more accurate than sequence-sequence aligments
* Profile-Profile alignments gain even more accuracy

**Question:** How do you build up a family \(profile\) of sequences?

> 1. Find proteins of similar structure with BLAST
> 2. Build PSSM
> 3. build up a set of pairwise alignments 
> 4. add those over a certain HSSP value to the family
> 5. Search with profile-sequence comparison for more distant family members and refine profile

* When building up a profile, start with a high threshold \(only very similar sequences are taken\)
* Later y
