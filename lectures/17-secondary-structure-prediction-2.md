#### 1. Recap

**Proteins: **

* are formed by stringing up amino acids in a chain
* amino acids are between 35 to 30.000 residues long
* amino acids form substructures, called domains in order to fold
* in principle: a domain put into solvent \(water\) folds on its own and adopts a unique 3D structure

**Zones: **There are different 'zones' by percentage of sequence identity, in which we can identify similar structures

*  **Daylight-Zone** \(100 % - 40%\)
  * Sequence - Sequence Alignment
  * Assumption: sequence similar -&gt; structure similar
* **Twilight-Zone **\(40% - 20%\)
  * Sequence - Profile Alignment
  * more distant relationships
* **Midnight-Zone** \(20% - 0%\)
  * Profile - Profile alignment
  * even more distant relationships

**Global and Local Alignment**



**Question: **Relate the terms **Local** and **Global alignment** to the terms **Sequence-Sequence** and **Sequence-Profile**.

> Global alignments refers to aligning sequences \(proteins\) from start to end. Local alignments refers to only aligning parts of the sequences \(e.g. 50 residues\).  
> Throughout Sequence-Sequence, Sequence-Profile and Profile-Profile methods both global and local alignment can be used. I practice mostly local alignment is done.
