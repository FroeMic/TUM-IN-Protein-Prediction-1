#### 1. Introduction Membrane

**Requirements for Cell Membrane**

* separate the content of the cell from its surroundings
* control traffic into and out of the cell
  * * keep malicious things out
    * let good things in
* must be a dynamic structure

**Main components of the cell membrane**

1. Carbohydrates
2. Cholesterol
3. Phospholipids
4. Proteins

##### Phospholipids

* form the barrier that separates the inside of a cell from the outside
* pospholipids are arranged in a **lipid bilayer**
  * **Inside: **fatty acid tails \(non-polar, hydrophobic\)
  * **Outside**: phosphate group \(polar, hydrophilic\)

##### Membrane Proteins

* Provide several functions to the cell
  * help to be recognized by immune cells
  * transport proteins control substance flow in and out of the cell
  * receptor proteins bind hormons, which can change cell function
  * provide structural stability
* Membrane proteins can \(easily\) shift around laterally 

**Membrane Proteins are especially important for drug targets**

# Note
Similar to the membrane, proteins also tend to have a **hydrophobic core**.
```

**Question:** What are the requirements of a cell membrane?

> * separate the content of the cell from its surroundings
> * control traffic into and out of the cell
>   * keep malicious things out
>   * let good things in
> * must be a dynamic structure

**Question:** What are the 4 main structural components of the cell membrane?

> Carbohydrates, Cholesterol, Phospholipids, Proteins

**Question:** What is the cell membrane mainly made out of?

> The cell membrane is a so called **lipid bilayer** of **phospholipids**. Phospholipids have a non-polar, hydrophobic tail \(membrane center\) and a polar, hydrophilic head \(outside of membrane\).

**Question:** What are functions of membrane proteins?

> * help to be recognized by immune cells
> * transport proteins control substance flow in and out of the cell
> * receptor proteins bind hormons, which can change cell function
> * provide structural stability

**Question:** Can membrane proteins easily move around?

> It depends:
>
> * Membrane proteins can easily move laterally
> * But it is hard to move into / out of the lipid bilayer

#### 2. Introduction Transmembrane Helix \(TMH\)

Although membrane proteins are especially interesting for drug targets, there are only limited 3D structures to be found in the PDB. Mostly, because it is extremely difficult to put them into a crystal in their 'natural' membrane environment.

**There are essentially 2 important questions when it comes to TMH prediction:**

* How many helices go through the membrane?
* In which direction do they go through the membrane? \(topology\)

**Question:** Why are there so few membrane proteins in the PDB?

> It is particularly difficult to experimentally determine the structure of membrane proteins due to the special environment they naturally occur \(the membrane\).

**Question:** What are they key questions TMH prediction tries to answer?

> * How many helices go through the membrane?
> * In which direction do they go through the membrane? \(topology\)
