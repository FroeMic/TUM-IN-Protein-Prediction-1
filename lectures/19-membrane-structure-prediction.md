#### 1. Introduction Membrane

**Requirements for Cell Membrane**

* separate the content of the cell from its surroundings
* control traffic into and out of the cell
  * * keep malicious things out
    * let good things in
* must be a dynamic structure

**Main components of the cell membrane**

1. Carbohydrates
2. Cholesterol
3. Phospholipids
4. Proteins

##### Phospholipids

* form the barrier that separates the inside of a cell from the outside
* pospholipids are arranged in a **lipid bilayer**
  * **Inside: **fatty acid tails \(non-polar, hydrophobic\)
  * **Outside**: phosphate group \(polar, hydrophilic\)

##### Membrane Proteins

* Provide several functions to the cell
  * help to be recognized by immune cells
  * transport proteins control substance flow in and out of the cell
  * receptor proteins bind hormons, which can change cell function
  * provide structural stability
* Membrane proteins can \(easily\) shift around laterally 

**Question:** What are the requirements of a cell membrane?

> * separate the content of the cell from its surroundings
> * control traffic into and out of the cell
>   * keep malicious things out
>   * let good things in
> * must be a dynamic structure

**Question:** What are the 4 main structural components of the cell membrane?

> Carbohydrates, Cholesterol, Phospholipids, Proteins

**Question:** What is the cell membrane mainly made out of?

> The cell membrane is a so called **lipid bilayer** of **phospholipids**. Phospholipids have a non-polar, hydrophobic tail \(membrane center\) and a polar, hydrophilic head \(outside of membrane\).

**Question:** What are functions of membrane proteins?

> * help to be recognized by immune cells
> * transport proteins control substance flow in and out of the cell
> * receptor proteins bind hormons, which can change cell function
> * provide structural stability

**Question:** Can membrane proteins easily move around?

> It depends:
>
> * Membrane proteins can easily move laterally
> * But it is hard to move into / out of the lipid bilayer
